## Background

The question that has ruined many a social event: 

> Who is the F1 greatest of all time (GOAT)?  

There are many opinions. Let's build a rating system to see if we can identify - at least - the data GOAT.

## Install

### Prerequisites

This project is built using Make, Python 3.11 and Poetry 1.8. Install these dependencies before continuing.

### Data 

Download the CSV database tables from [^1] and unzip them into `data/raw`. The table structure for these tables can be found in [^2].

### Environment

Run `make env` in a command line interface (e.g. iTerm) to install Python dependencies for this project.

## Usage

The algorithm can be found in `src/f1_elo`. Run `make data_e2e` to build the model and predict ratings per driver and constructor for all races.

The streamlit app can be found in `src/f1_elo`. Run `make app` to explore the app locally.

## Testing

This project has no tests.

## Contributing

This project is open to issue submissions for bugs and improvements to make this app better.

If suggesting edits to the README, please conform to the [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
